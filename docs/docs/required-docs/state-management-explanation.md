# State Management Explanation

This project uses **React Query** for state management related to API data fetching. The reasons for choosing React Query include:

- **Automatic Caching:**  
  Reduces redundant API calls and improves performance by caching responses.

- **Background Updates:**  
  Supports automatic and manual data refreshing to ensure the displayed data is up-to-date.

- **Built-in Loading & Error Handling:**  
  Simplifies management of different UI states (loading, success, error) without extensive custom code.

- **Ease of Integration:**  
  Offers a simple API that integrates smoothly with React components, making asynchronous data handling much more manageable.

## Why Not Zustand or the Context API?

- **Zustand:**  
  Although Zustand is a lightweight state management library, it lacks built-in support for the specialized features required for asynchronous data fetching (like caching and background revalidation) that React Query offers. So I think React Query makes it a better fit for this project.

- **Context API:**  
  The Context API is useful for sharing state across components, but it does not provide the advanced features needed for efficient API data management. Implementing caching, automatic refetching, and detailed error handling with the Context API would require significantly more boilerplate code and custom logic compared to using React Query.
